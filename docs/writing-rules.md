*Reference document for consistent, high-quality website content*

---

## CONTENT STRATEGY

### Core Principles

1. **Value-First Approach**: Lead with client benefits, not capabilities
2. **Technical Credibility**: Specific details demonstrate expertise
3. **Swiss Market Tone**: Professional, elegant, non-promotional
4. **Experience-Based**: Real project examples over theoretical claims
5. **Business Relevance**: Technical topics translated for decision-makers

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Swiss business leaders and technical decision-makers
- **Secondary**: Implementation teams seeking proven AI partners
- **Tertiary**: Practitioners evaluating production LLM expertise

---

## TONE & VOICE

### Required Tone

- **Professional**: Swiss business standard
- **Confident**: State capabilities directly without hedging
- **Credible**: Technical depth without overwhelming non-experts
- **Non-promotional**: Expertise demonstration, not hard selling
- **Empowering**: Build clients up; frame AI as opportunity, not threat

### Avoid

- Hype, slang, or cheesy hooks
- Anxiety-inducing language ("you're falling behind", "before it's too late")
- Excessive superlatives ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "best-in-class")
- Promotional buzzwords ("cutting-edge", "world-class", "enterprise-grade")

---

## WRITING STANDARDS

### Clarity Rules

- **One concept per sentence** when possible
- **Sentence length**: Keep under 35 words; split longer sentences
- **Active voice**: "We build" not "Systems are built"
- **Concrete over abstract**: Specific outcomes over vague promises

### Formatting Rules

- **No em dashes** (—): Use commas, semicolons, or colons instead
- **No exclamation points**: Professional confidence needs no emphasis
- **Consistent lists**: Use dashes (-) for unordered lists
- **Articles before nouns**: "the system" not just "system" in body text

### Language Patterns to Avoid

**AI-sounding vocabulary** (high detection signal):
- "delve", "showcase", "underscore", "pivotal"
- "realm", "landscape", "paradigm", "tapestry"
- "meticulous", "nuanced", "multifaceted"
- "robust", "seamless", "leverage", "utilize"
- "harness", "empower", "elevate", "foster"

**Replace with**:
- "delve" → "examine" or describe directly
- "landscape" → name the specific context
- "leverage" → "use"
- "utilize" → "use"
- "robust" → "reliable" or describe what makes it so
- "seamless" → describe the integration specifically

**Overused transitions** (replace or omit):
- "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally" → "Also" or restructure
- "Indeed", "Certainly" → omit
- "It's worth noting that" → just state the point
- "In essence", "Ultimately" → omit

**Hedging phrases** (delete or rephrase confidently):
- "One might argue" → make the argument
- "It could be said that" → say it
- "It's crucial to understand" → just explain

### Jargon Discipline

Use specialist terms only when necessary. When used, pair with brief plain-language explanation.

**Common tech jargon to replace**:
- "downstream" → "later" or "that follows"
- "upstream" → "earlier"
- "surface" (as verb) → "reveal" or "show"
- "iterate" → "repeat" or "refine"
- "optimize" → "improve" (unless specific metric involved)

## CONTENT SECTIONS

### Hero Section

- **Company name**: Clear, prominent
- **Tagline**: One line describing core offering
- **Sub-tagline**: Specific value proposition (security, reliability, cost)
- **CTAs**: Action-oriented, not salesy ("Get Started" not "Buy Now")

### About Section

- Lead with client benefit, not company history
- Include specific trust signals (metrics, clients, credentials)
- Quantify achievements where possible ("34% improvement over baseline")

### Services Section

- **Titles**: Clear service names, not marketing labels
- **Descriptions**: What client gets, not how we do it
- Focus on outcomes and deliverables

### Testimonials Section

- Use real quotes from real people
- Include role and relationship context
- Select quotes that speak to specific capabilities

### Contact Section

- Clear call-to-action
- Reduce friction (immediate availability, location)
- Professional contact details
